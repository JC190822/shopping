My simple shopping python program:
This shopping python website asks the user what 3 objects he\she wants as well as the price for each of the objects.
The objects are then added to a list, as well as the total sum of all the objects are calculated and the average price of all 3 objects are calculated.
All this detail is then printed out to be presented to the user.

Installation: 
Save the python file into any directory of your choice. Navigate to that cirectory using your terminal with "cd 'directory'" and then run "python3 shopping2.0.py".
You can also open it on Virtual Studios and run it on the app's terminal.
